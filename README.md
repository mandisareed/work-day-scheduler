A interactive app that allows the user to input tasks and/or events in a daily scheduler.

This app is geared towards a user who wants to update their life - one day at a time - and keep track of tasks according to current time of day.
The user can add tasks, events, and other to-dos as they come to mind.
The app is not yet mobile-friendly, so it works and looks best on a desktop or tablet.
Future developments include making the app mobile-responsive and clearing the stored tasks when a new day begins.
